Should be a file-sharing-first platform. Sort of blog-like where anybody can submit a post to a global feed that anyone on the server can view. People on the server can then reply to the post either with another rich-media comment or plain text.\n    This could be web only but it would be useful to have a mobile app as well for push notifications and being able to save media offline.<h4>Instances</h4>\n    Self hosted by users or hosted by us. Access should be restricted to invite-only by the server's owner. Everything should be customizable including css styling of all components. Maybe even specific to users within a server.\n    Possibility of also having each private server have a public-facing page (also stylized) that lets a group showcase work or ask for help within a specific area of expertise the group could use help with. Possibly make servers peer-discoverable.\n<h4>Posts</h4>Posts can contain any type of file or link (audio file, video, link, text, program-specific project files, zip, w/e) with additional text. Posts could be made to either showcase work, simply post for the sake of sharing it, or ask for comments / collaboration. Posts are displayed like blog entries in a main feed.\n\n<u>Display features:</u>\n[-] text\n     - pure text (maybe markdown or at least html/css)\n     - link + text\n[-] visual <i>(single or gallery)</i>\n     - images\n     - videos\n     - gifs\n[-] audio\n    - single track <i>(or album or playlist)</i>\n    - album\n    - playlist of files\n    - spotify (detect link and embed player(?))\n[-] files\n    - software project files (.psd, .als, .blend, etc...)\n    - .zip, .img, .iso, .w/e\n\nMake it easy to listen to audio with a click-once-and-let-play function.\nEveryone within the server should be able to comment.\nComments should also be able to contain rich media.\nCan like / repost comments and posts.\nTag posts using custom keywords (or by color).\nTag @people in a post or comment to send them push notification.\nCan also subscribe to custom keyword tags to get notified.\n\n<h4>Business Model</h4><h5><u>Personal</u></h5>Acts as a mini social network.\n\nThey host: <i>(free)</i>\n- users can choose to host their own instance free of charge\n- we just provide the software\n\nWe host: <i>(free or paid)</i>\n- we host a free tier that places some restrictions on file size\n- provide paid tier the lets users post full-size files without restrictions\n    - subscription fee / month (maybe $10-20 range?)\n    - Apple Pay \"pool\" where everyone in the server participates and subscribes for $2/month to join\n        - must be easy to subscribe / unsub\n<h5><u>Professional</u></h5>\nActs as a project tracker / easy dropoff colaboration platform.\n\nThey host: <i>(paid)</i>\n- sold as a SaaS\n- like personal version with more specific project tracking functions\n\nWe host: <i>(paid)</i>\n- sold as a SaaS\n- should be easy to spawn new instances on a per-project basis\n- also bill for storage costs\n                \n                </div>\n            </ul>\n        </details>\n        <p>\n        This page is still missing a lot of features and for now is mostly handcrafted from previous projects.\n        </p>\n        <div>\n            <!-- Text post -->\n            <details class=\"border\">\n                <summary>TODO</summary>\n                <ul style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; max-width: 720px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;\" ><p style=\"color: lightgrey\">[  ]  user accounts\n[  ]  ability to post\n    [  ]  upload files / media\n    [  ]  generate html from .md-like syntax\n[  ]  ability to post comments\n[  ]  tagging people\n[  ]  fix media player for multiple tracks\n[  ]  finish todo list</p></ul></details>\n    </div>\n </div>\n",
